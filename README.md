## <p align="center"><a name="aboutme"> 🤗 ABOUT ME 🤗 </a>
My name is Janek, and I’m passionate about learning, especially in software testing and IT. I’m seeking a role with more growth opportunities. I’ve always enjoyed working with computers—fixing, optimizing, and even writing Java programs. I strive to combine productivity with enjoyment, constantly improving myself and living by the idea that ‘you can always become a little better.’ Lifelong development is my goal

Junior Platform Operations Representative - 
 ![Customer wow champion](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fea5e2f-e349-433e-8c07-71187af41e6b)

My job is to maintain the operations on the platform created by Lsports. All of the operations are kind of the operations on the database of sports data and all of the related circumstances. We are creating, storing and constantly changing thousends of fixtures at the same time so there is a lot of data that can be corrupted by any automation so my job is mostly about finding those issues and solving them up the way that it may not appear once again in the future. This is very creative and analitical work as the issues are mostly covered bu multiple layers of informations and it is really easy to find but really hard to solve.

## <p align="center"><a name="languages"> 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 LANGUAGES 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 </a>
As languages are really important part of every kind of job in IT I decided to write a little about it and how it looks in my life. 
- **English** - Thats why I am writing all my sources in English is to show you that I can use it and use it well I think. I wrote whole portfolio and CV in English 
and I try to use it as much as I can to be better and better. I watch movies, listen to podcasts, read books in this language and have very little difficulties overall. It may be a little more time consuming with some 
unusual phrases, or words that I just don't know yet. I love this language and hope to use it in my future work almost all the time.

- **Italian** - I spent 7 months in Italy in two parts. First I went on practices, and second time I went to take part in an intern opportunity. At that time I could speak almost fluently in English so I knew
it won't be hard for me to learn the next one. And I started to learn and became a communicative in this language in a really short period of time. I would describe myself in this language as A1 
because I can exchange thoughts with italians. But it is not like I am native or something. Just huge basics and really good understanding in practice at work not from books.

- **Spanish** - I have learned this language for a few years before I started learning Italian. Spanish helped me to better understand Italian language. For now my Spanish understanding is a little outdated
because of lack of time. But this is on my list after becoming really good in Italian to become fluent also in Spanish. What I can tell (what even surprised me)
was when we had a visitation at work from Spanish mother factory. I could communicate with spanish people as well as almost anyone else and I almost did't need to use a translator.

Connecting my English skills with Italian and Spanish and confidency to speak in other language without fear of being rejected makes me a really international human being.
